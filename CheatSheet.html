                1.	What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The most essential technologies which made the World Wide Web such a success is the HTTP protocol for transferring the data, the Hypertext Markup Language (=html), which made it easy to create websites and as a third the web browser as a client program, which displayed the transferred data in the described way.
            </p>

            <h4>
                2.	How are resources (html pages, images, etc.) addressed in the web?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The browser resolves the server name of the URL (example.org) into an Internet Protocol address using the globally distributed Domain Name System (DNS). The browser then requests the resource by sending an HTTP request across the Internet to the computer at that address.
            </p>

            <h4>
                3.	What are the components of a URL?

                http             = protocol <br>
                www.example.com  = hostname <br>
                index.html		 = file name <br>

        </h3>
        
        <h4>Properly name the components of HTML elements</h4>

    The <strong>html</strong> element is the root element and defines the entire HTML document.
    Then inside the html element there is a body element

    The <strong>body</strong> element defines the body of the document.
    Then inside the body element there are two other elements: <strong>h1 and p</strong>

    The <strong>h1</strong> element defines a heading
    The <strong>p</strong> element defines a paragraph

<h4>Identify void elements and how they are denoted</h4>
 
    The <strong>br</strong> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.

<h4>Identify attributes</h4>
 
    The <strong>a</strong> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
    The <strong>img</strong> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed
    The img tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels)
    The required <strong>alt</strong> attribute for the img tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed
    This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
    The <strong>style</strong> attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
    You should always include the <strong>long</strong> attribute inside the html tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    The <strong>title</strong> attribute defines some extra information about an element

<h4>Write down the correct DOCTYPE declaration for html 5</h4>
 
    !DOCTYPE html<br/>

<h4>Write down syntactically correct statements for the following elements</h4>

<h5>Headings (h1, ...)</h5><br/>

    h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading
    h1 headings should be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings, then the less important h3, and so on.

    The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag and the body tag.

<h5>Top level element (html)</h5><br/>

    The title element is required in HTML documents!
    
    The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
    
    The title element:<br/>
    
    defines a title in the browser toolbar<br/>
    provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    displays a title for the page in search engine-results
    So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

<h5>Link to other pages (a)</h5><br/>

    The <strong>a</strong> tag defines a hyperlink

<h5>Comment</h5><br/>

    You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax
    Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag

    With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code

    Comments can be used to hide content.
    This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily
    You can also hide more than one line. Everything between them will be hidden from the display

    Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code
